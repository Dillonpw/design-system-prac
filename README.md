# Astro Tailwind React Design system practice

the goal of this project is to create a neobrutalist themed page by first setting up th edesign system, then implemeneting the pieces.

Step 1 in the process was to establish the theme, I settled on a neobrutal theme, with miininal features for clarity, and a block like font called quantico for emphasized text. While I kept in mind that I could use font size for differentiating importance, I wanted to instead opt for using visual heirarchy where possible. This can be seen in the Cards.

Step 2 Was to select a color palette, using a color wheel and locating complimetary colors to the primary. The Idea was bright, light colors to appear pastel-like. Once the colors were selected I designed a tailwind-style scale for the colors and extended the tailwind theme

Step 3 consisted of developing some reusable ui components with react, starting with a button with several size and color options, then a card to display data with similar design options.

Step 4 was to create a header using the selected fonts and correct button size for the job with mobile in mind.
